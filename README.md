## Athlete Training Analysis (NumPy Project)
This project simulates and analyzes sports training data using NumPy.
The script generates 20 days of training results for 10 athletes across four performance metrics:
 • Sprint — time for a short-distance run (seconds)
 • Push-ups — number of push-ups per minute
 • Long jump — distance in meters
 • Heart rate — beats per minute (BPM)
## Features
 • Generate a synthetic dataset of athlete training sessions.
 • Identify the best athletes in sprint, push-ups, and long jump.
 • Find record-breaking results across all days.
 • Determine the most consistent sprinter based on variance.
 • Days when all athletes ran faster than a given time.
 • Days when any athlete jumped further than a set distance.
 • Categorize athletes based on sprint speed and heart rate levels.
## Project Structure
 1. generated_data.py — generates the dataset with random training results.
 2. analyze.py — contains all analysis functions.
 3. main.py — the main script that calls analysis functions and outputs results.
## Installation
This project requires Python 3.6+ and NumPy.
```bash
pip install numpy
```
## Usage
Run the main script to generate data and display the monthly activity summary:
